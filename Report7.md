## Caleb Mays, Software Developer ##

  * Tasks accomplished: The week before spring break wasn't very productive for me; I feel like I wasn't given anything super-specific to do, having said that, I made sure Chris knew that if he needed/wanted help, to ask me. I helped him a little bit, but really, I don't feel like I did very much at all.
  * Future tasks researched: Level of detail things.
  * Most immediate upcoming tasks: Start writing the documents for the final presentation: the user manual, maintenance manual, etc...
