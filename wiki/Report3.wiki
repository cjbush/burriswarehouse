==Caleb Mays, Software Developer==

   * Tasks accomplished: Added another character into the warehouse, and will continue to add characters when I can; not going to be a huge priority. I know they work. Worked on my "issues" to get a better idea of what needs to be done, and divided them up into sub-tasks with approximate times. 
   * Future tasks researched: Began thinking through collision detection. Chris and I came up with a basic design.
   * Most immediate upcoming tasks: Figure out "collision detection" with a custom bounding box system.
