#summary Report for 4/11-4/17

=Report=

==Caleb Mays, Software Developer==

   * Tasks accomplished: Unfortunately, I found myself quite busy this week with some other classes and life stuff, so I wasn't able to put as much time into documenting as I would have liked. Added comments to collision detection classes and NPC classes (ones which I wrote). 
   * Most immediate upcoming tasks: Test and adjust the collision detection specifically around the air door guards. Try to make it a little easier to drive through those; presentation stuff. 


==Dan Jewett, Modeler/Software Developer==

   * Tasks accomplished:  Box problem fixed, resolved missing textures and resized swingarm as asked for.  Added a horn sound effect as well as commenting all of my code (that I had not done) and added headers for PickSim on all of the code I thought we wrote.  I wrote four tutorials/manuals of things that I had done that may help next years team as far as graphics go (GUY.md5, Exporting OBJ Models from Maya, Baking Textures and Warehouse.ma).  I also added permanent positions to many misc. objects scattered across the warehouse.
   * Most immediate upcoming tasks: Presentation, Posters, testing, oh my!


==Chris Bush, Team Leader/Software Developer/Network Specialist==

  * Tasks accomplished: Edited installation manual, began Vocollect installation/maintenance manual, edited templates for issue tracking to more easily identify bugs, fixed autocompletion rollover crash bug, discovered three other bugs (see issue 34, issue 38, and issue 39)
  * Most immediate upcoming tasks: Resolve issue 38 and issue 39, continue editing and creating documentation, finish autocompletion Vocollect prompts, continue debugging & testing
