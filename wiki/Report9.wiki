==Dan Jewett, Modeler/Software Developer==

   * Tasks accomplished: Camera fixes.  DProduct is completely rewritten.  No longer uses the generic box anymore.  Dynamically creates a box for dynamic textures soon to be.  Re-adjusted the lighting.  Tweaked RandomPerson so people aren't so much giants. Added a ceiling to the warehouse.  CLOD doesn't work, so I added a far clipping plane with fog.  This will only render a certain area.  I also took the original xml file that the first team did and added the surrounding room thing again, but with the clipping plane.
   * Future tasks researched: Rendering, Animation, Texturing, Lighting.
