==1.1 Project overview==
===1.1a Context===

Burris Logistics is a frozen goods storage and shipping company. They operate several warehouses, mostly along the Eastern Seaboard, that are responsible for loading and unloading outgoing and incoming shipments, respectively, and storing the received products until such a time as they will be shipped elsewhere. Since Burris specializes in refrigerated and frozen goods, all of their warehouses are refrigerated. Each warehouse has several different temperature zones that must be maintained at a given temperature based on the requirements of the product stored in that section of the warehouse.

This project concerns the internal workings of the Burris warehouse in Elkton, Maryland. Most of the tasks in the warehouse can be grouped into two broad categories: inbound and outbound.  All of the goods that are received from incoming shipments must be unloaded, processed, and then moved to the proper storage location. Conversely, whenever a shipment leaves from the warehouse, the correct products must be collected from their storage locations, prepared for shipping, and loaded onto the truck.

Warehouse workers are assigned to the various parts of each process, along with some other tasks that do not fit directly into either category.  In particular, there are warehouse workers assigned to unloading incoming good from a truck and processing them. There are also workers assigned to taking these goods and placing them in the correct storage location. Furthermore, there are workers assigned to collecting goods that must be placed on an outbound truck and place these collected goods in the correct loading dock. There are workers assigned to the processing of collected goods, ensuring that the correct goods were collected; and there are workers assigned to preparing and loading the goods onto the truck. There are also workers that are assigned to replenishing the pick-up location of each product that is collected for outgoing shipments.

Initially, this project will mainly concern the job of the workers assigned to the collecting of goods to be placed on the loading dock for outgoing shipments. These workers are called “pickers” or “selectors” (see definitions).  Burris uses a voice recognition system, called Vocollect, to direct the pickers through their assigned tasks. The Vocollect system gives commands and then waits for the worker to confirm the command and/or give it more information, as required for any given situation. The most common sequence is where the picker is (1) told to go to a certain location in the warehouse, designated by aisle and bin numbers. (2) Once the worker has reached the given location he must relay a series of number, called check digits, that are used to double check that the worker has, in fact, reached the correct bin.

(3) Once the picker relays the correct check digits (s)he is told the how much product to pick up. The worker picks up the given amount of products and places them on the pallet or pallets that the goods will eventually be shipped on. (4) The picker then confirms that (s)he picked up the given amount of product. The process then repeats as the worker is directed to a new bin location for the next selection. Steps (1)-(4) are repeated until the picker has completed the pick job, at which point the worker places some labels on the product and drops the pallet or pallets off at the loading dock. The worker then tells the Vocollect system that (s)he is ready to begin another pick job, at which point a new pick task is assigned.

The rate at which Burris pays each worker is based, in part, on his or her productivity. This is done using a set of Engineering Labor Standards which specify how much time an average worker takes to complete a given task. Worker pay is partially based on productivity relative to the ELS.

===1.1b Application (what will/should it do)===

This project will produce a video-game-like application that can be used to help train warehouse workers, specifically the selector, on how to do their jobs. The application should accurately model the Elkton warehouse and relevant equipment used by selectors. The application should interface with the Vocollect technology so that the users can learn how to properly interact with the technology. The application should also be able to train the users in the proper use and operation of the needed equipment.

Initially, the application should simulate the daily tasks of a picker. However, the application should be developed in such a way that will provide the ability to generalize the application for any or all warehouse tasks.

===1.1c User(s)===

The primary users will consist primarily of two parties: the warehouse trainers and the warehouse trainees. The trainers are well-versed in the inner workings of the warehouse and must become familiar with this application to understand its capabilities and limitations. The trainees may have some knowledge of various warehouse jobs based on previous employment, but will most likely have little to no experience with the Vocollect technology or Burris-specific procedures. Both parties may also have varying computer skills, according to their various backgrounds.

===1.1d Purpose (usefulness)===

This application will help Burris train new employees for working in the warehouse. In particular, this application will help train those who have little to no experience with Vocollect, the process of completing selection tasks, or the layout of the warehouse.

==1.2 Project Deliverables==

  * Documentation
    * Detailing how to use the application
    * Code documentation for further development and/or debugging purposes
  * Application
    * A functional application that accomplishes at least the requirements described above. This includes a connector for the Vocollect known as the JSL, the actual virtual warehouse application, a database for pick jobs to be used for the Vocollect, and an already built layout for the Elkton warehouse.

==1.4 Definitions and Acronyms==
_Much thanks for this section is owed to Amaya Dixit, who provided many of the definitions listed in this section._

•       aisle – Any passageway within a storage area.

    o   main aisle – A passageway to permit the flow of equipment, supplies, and personnel; it generally runs the length of the building and is wide enough to permit vehicles to pass.

    o   cross-aisle – A passageway at right angles to main aisles and access aisles, used for the movement of supplies, equipment and personnel.

•       Argent (APT) - ELS system used by Burris to calculate the amount of pay a worker receives. This payment is based on the amount of work the worker actually achieves, based on time usage and efficiency

•       check code - a several-digit number that is used to verify that a picker as reached the correct pick bin. The check code will be printed on a magnetic label. The labels are periodically moved so that the picker does not know the check code before they reach the pick bin. These are sometimes referred to as check digits.

•       cycle-counting – A method of taking physical inventory in which only a percentage of items are counted at a time but eventually all inventory is counted.

•       racks – Metal framework upon which units or unitized loads are placed.

    o   single deep pallet rack – Also known as selective pallet rack. Originally designed for pallet storage but can also be designed to accept decking or cross bracing to allow for placing multiple items per level without pallets in case of slower moving items.

    o   double deep pallet racks – It allows for storing two pallets deep. Widely used in the Elkton Location for storing high volume items and to provide for high volume storage for our vendors.

•       Raymond Reach Truck – also known as a high-low. A vehicle with forks that can be raised and lowered, this is distinguished by the fact that the forks can be raise high enough to reach the top bin of a rack. This is the vehicle used by warehouse workers assigned to refill the pick bins.
