Introduction

This is our second wiki-based weekly report. As such, it includes both the weekly report and those notes which which we took on our first advisor meeting on 24 Jan.

Report Summary

This week we migrated our repository to Google Code to provide issue tracking, wiki functionality, and a public subversion repository. We also began implementation of a data-driven controller interface.

*Chris Bush, Team Leader/Vocollect/Network/Database Developer

    + _Tasks accomplished:_ Migrated repository to Google Code (see instructional email). Began design and implementation of data-driven controller interface for player. Briefly assisted Caleb with NPC design. Began script to crawl Google Images for product texturing. 

    + _Most immediate upcoming tasks:_ Finish controller interface and web crawler for product texturing. 

*Caleb Mays, Software Developer

    + _Tasks accomplished:_ Designed and Partially implemented Autonomous characters (Npc) class. I worked with Dan to get the autonomous characters actually into the warehouse. I helped Dan find the random pallet-jack that was being loaded right underneath the player. Also, I worked with Dan to find that we were actually initializing the system and game twice. 

    + _Future tasks researched:_ Helped Dan begin to fix the collision detection when backing into the wall. I will also perhaps work with Dan a bit on this in the future. 

    + _Most immediate upcoming tasks:_ This week I will begin coding a shortest path algorithm so that the characters will move about the warehouse. I hope to be actually finding the path characters should go done by the end of the week, and then have the characters actually moving sometime next week. 

*Dan Jewett, Modeler/Software Developer

    + _Tasks accomplished:_ Modified the MD5 class to allow for random textures for the autonomous characters. Got the SVN working with Google code. Fixed a lot of small issues, such as extra cameras and lighting. Found a major problem in that it loaded the whole game twice and solved this issue. Those were the major things. 

    + _Research for future tasks:_ Animation, texturing 

    + _Most immediate upcoming tasks:_ Fix texture problems. Figure out other ways to make the game run much faster. Increase clutter in warehouse.
