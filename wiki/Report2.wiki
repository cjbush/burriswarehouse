=Meeting Notes / Task Assignments=

  * General - Set up labels for issue tracking; Do code profiling to figure out where resources are being used the most (use TPTP)
  * Chris - Set up wiki page to match milestones to release dates; Commit code for controller interface
  * Caleb - Implement meaningful NPC paths using waypoints rather than random movement in the warehouse; Get them moving by 1/31
  * Dan - Check where NPC's are being placed in the scene graph


=Caleb Mays, Software Developer=

   * Tasks accomplished: Implemented the way point system with Npcs. Characters are now walking and moving through the warehouse.

   * Future tasks researched: Spent a few minutes looking at collision detection issues. 

   * Most immediate upcoming tasks: Two things: Finish entering paths and way-points so that a reasonable number of characters populate the warehouse, and look into collision detection problems, specifically when riding a pallet jack.
